1. Data Type:
 - Integer
 - float
 - Boolean : False/True
 - String : With ""
 
 2. How to know the data type? print(type(A))
 3. How to chage the data type? str(A)
 
 4.
 a = "Hello"
 b = print(a[0])
 >H
 
 5. round()
 6. type(4//2) >> int and the result will be 2
 
 7. Final project:
 
# Example Input

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
```

# Example Output

```
Each person should pay: $19.93
```

 My answer:
 
 
print("Welcome to the calculator!")
bill = float(input(print("What was the total bill? $")))
tip = int(input(print("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? ")))
split = int(input(print("How many people to split the bill?")))
print(split)

pay = round(float(bill * (1+(tip/100)) / split),2)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${pay}")
